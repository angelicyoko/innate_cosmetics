Website for Innate Cosmetics

This website will have the purpose of selling cosmetics.
Ideally will be in reactJS... open to suggestions.
Secondly, the backend will probably be hosted with AWS, and the domain name is innate-cosmetics.com via google domains.

First steps:
1. download node.js
2. for the actual react app, in terminal in chosen directory, npx create-react-app [name of project goes here]
3. Run Commands
    1. npm start   -> start the server for development
    2. npm run build  -> bundles the app into static files for production
    3. npm test   -> start test runner
    4. npm run eject   -> remove this tool and copies build dependencies, config   files, and scripts into the app directory. IF YOU DO THIS YOU CAN'T UNDO
4. cd into newly created app directory
7. npm install -S react-router-dom
6. npm start  -> woot woot! should pop open local host browser

Project Start on 10/15/21 using this tutorial =>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2UBjN5ER4s 
Knowledge of ReactJS and general web development, nil
10/16/21 time to judge it up and make it my own...
11/18/21 update: wireframes completed, time to crash course javascript, html, and css. Gonna attempt this through adobeXD and anima or react native generator.

Some things I have learned about myself, I do not think I have an eye for design lol.
